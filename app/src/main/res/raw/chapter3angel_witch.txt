I followed the girls to a big avenue close to the bar we were a bit earlier.
It seemed the most promising place to look for directions since the narrow streets back there were almost empty at this time of the day, but…
This place wasn’t much different if you ask me.
There was a convenience store pretty much run down, a photo booth hidden in a fishy dead end and an old railroad in the background.
However there wasn’t any people to be found here. At all.
It actually makes sense since we are in the hottest month of summer and it’s almost noon.
I thought we would stand out like a sore thumb dressing like this, but seems like humidity and this oppressive heat was keeping people to come out from home.
And the thing is…
I didn’t know if I felt glad or upset by it.
To be honest I was secretly relieved of not having to admit to a random stranger that I was lost while looking like this.
So even if that means I’ll miss that cosplay event I still rather stay here cooking my ass under the sun than having to go through that.
Besides, I just wanted to go there -partially- because I wanted to try my luck meeting some girl, so…
I think I’m well served in that regard.

*happyLeftPosition*
Hu, hu…
What are you looking at, sweetie?
*buttons*
U-uh, I think yours… -y’know- are showing…
N-nothing! *blush*
Sorry, I was just absent-minded for a bit.
*happyLeftPosition*
Ha, ha! I knew that already, sweetheart…
*normalLeftPosition*
I wish I knew what is exactly that “nothing” that makes you blush like that.
*angryLeftPosition*
I see. You should focus in what’s in front of you instead of being somewhere else, boy.
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
Hey, can I know what the two of you are talking about?
Y’know, it’s quite rude to exclude someone of a conversation.
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
Oh, we are not excluding anyone from anything, sweetie.
*happyLeftPosition*
The boy here was just staring at these.
And you’re free to do the same, of course.
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
W-what?! Why should I-?!
…
Wait, you do this on purpose, don’t you?
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
…Te-hee!
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
Ok, that’s it. I had enough.
I’m finding the damn place with or without your help and when I do…
I swear I’m going to pretend as if I don’t know who the hell are you lot, you hear me?
Am I being clear?!
*buttons*
Hey, are you feeling all right? 
Hey, she was just messing with you.
Crystal clear.
*angryRightPosition*
W-what? Of course I am! What do you mean if I’m-?
*angryRightPosition*
Really? Well, then she should stop doing that or I’ll be really pissed off.
*angryRightPosition*
Wonderful! Then get lost and leave me the heck of-
*angryRightPosition*
…
*normalRightPosition*
…U-uh?
I think I’m feeling… a bit queasy.
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
I see, so that’s why you were so pale...
*angryLeftPosition*
It’s probably just the heat, we have been walking under direct sunlight for awhile after all.
Hear me boy, do you mind to sit her down and watch her for a bit while I’m gone?
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
W-wait, I can… take care of myself!
*buttons*
I know, but don’t push yourself too much, ok?
Sure, but sit down and rest for a bit.
*ignore her* Hey, where are you going, lady?!
*happyRightPosition*
A-all right, I won’t… Thanks.
*normalRightPosition*
Ok, I will…
*angryRightPosition*
Ha! Isn’t there anything else you can think of other than bwebs, you perv?
*normalRightPosition*
…
*angryRightPosition*
Hey, I’m… sorry about earlier.
I know I can be hard to deal with sometimes, it’s just…
I-I can’t control it, especially when I’m nervous.
*buttons*
Does that mean you were nervous before?
It’s ok, don’t worry about that.
That sounds like a lame excuse to me.
*happyRightPosition*
W-well, I WAS going to go on a blind date with someone I met online, so…
*normalRightPosition*
No, I insist. I treated you horribly…
*angryRightPosition*
Well, I can’t blame you for hating me now…
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
Hey kiddos, I’m back!
…Hm?
*happyLeftPosition*
Do I interrupt something?
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
U-uh?! No, you didn’t…!
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
I see…
Here, I brought you some cold water. Drink it slowly, ok?
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
…
*happyRightPosition*
Thank you…
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
Oh, you’re welcome sweetie! I’m just glad to see you’re recovering the red on your cheeks.
*angryLeftPosition*
But I have bad news for you…
I bought that bottle in the convenience store back there, so I asked for directions to the guy inside and…
Seems like we are not going anywhere today. Sorry, honey.
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
W-wait, what? What do you mean by that?
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
It’s the cosplay event, sweetie. It seems that there was a mistake in the website regarding the date.
The cosplay con is actually programmed for next weekend.
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
…
*angryRightPosition*
What?!
That’s complete bullshit!! Why did I have to suffer this ridiculous heat for then?!
I’m going to sue that damn website and make them compensate me for it!!
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
…Te-hee!
I’m glad our little angel recovered her energy…
She’s cuter with that frown, don’t you think?
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
Hey, what are you two talking about?!
*normalRightPosition*
Anyway, I suppose this means we are splitting, aren’t we?
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
I guess so, there is not much to do here other than getting some tan.
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
Yikes, no thank you…
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
Oh? But I think it would suit you marvellously.
…
Te-hee!
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
Is she laughing at me or flirting? I can’t get this woman at all…
*normalRightPosition*
Anyway, I’m leaving. Thanks a lot for everything.
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
Don’t mention it, sweetie. It was a pleasure to meet you two.
Take care!
