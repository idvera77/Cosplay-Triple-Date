I went outside as they told me to and waited there for a bit.
They were taking their time, but I guess it’s to be expected of a shortstaffed place like this.
Not that I minded, as I was very confused about it all.
So I used the opportunity to sort out my thoughts about the situation.
Apparently, I spoke to the three of them at the same time, not knowingly of course.
The thing is that I received messages coming from an anon user in the site.
But that’s just the default name for a non-registered user, so technically they could be from different persons.
But I thought they all were from just one girl!
What do I do now? This is supposed to be a date!
Just when I was starting to panic all over again I hear the door at my back opening.
I turn around to figure out who it was and…
I see the girl in the white and blue costume coming out…
And that other girl in the cat costume.
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
Jesus, how much time did they need to bring the bill to the table?
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, sorry about that…
Oh, I almost forgot.
*angryLeftPosition*
Did you finally talk to that weird woman at the back? The one that was staring at us all the time… 
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Huh? What do you mean weird?
*angryRightPosition*
Ugh, don’t tell me that my tail fell all over again! 
*Turns again and again, chasing her tail like she’s a puppy playing with the thing*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh!
*happyRightPosition*
Nevermind, it’s just back there as it should. He, he!
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
…
Who the hell are you?
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Hm? Didn’t he tell you?
We all are coming together to the cosplay con!
*angel*
*normalLeftPosition*
…
*angryLeftPosition*
Wait, what?!
What does she mean she’s coming?!
Don’t tell me… 
Did you invite more than one girl to come?!
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Why, of course he did!
*happyRightPosition*
The more the merrier, right Kirito?
*buttons*
Exactly!
Yeah, it’s kind of… nice, I guess?
This was a mistake.
*happyRightPosition*
Yay!
*normalRightPosition*
Yes, that was exactly what I meant: Ni-ce!
*angryRightPosition*
…Huh? Why is this a mistake, exactly?
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…You’re not the brightest bulb in the box, aren’t you?
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, let’s… forget about that for now.
If we want to get to that cursed event we’ll better be on or way. And soon.
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, I was about to say the same thing!
But without… the “cursed” thing.
*angryRightPosition*
W-wait, don’t tell me that the event… 
T-the event… really is…?
*buttons*
Don’t worry, the event is completely fine.
Nah, I don’t think she meant it that way.
Yup, it’s haunted and full of evil spirits.
*happyRightPosition*
Oh, thank god! I was worried there for a second.
*normalRightPosition*
Pfew! What a relief… I hate ghosts and the like.
*angryRightPosition*
E-EEEK! I can’t stand scary things, PLEASE!
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
For the love of…
*normalLeftPosition*
Ok, you know what? From now on I’ll just talk to you, Kiki.
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Kiki? Who’s that?
Oh I know! Is there anybody else coming with us then, Kirito?
*happyRightPosition*
Then they should hurry! We’re going to be late for the costume contest! 
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
*Counts to 10 in whispers*
Uh, whatever…
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, let’s get going.
I think I might know the place just enough to get there.
*angryLeftPosition*
I mean, it’s been awhile, but…
I think I can manage.
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Hm? Does that mean you know the way?
*happyRightPosition*
Great, because I don’t have the faintest!
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
Why that does not surprise me, I wonder…
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, follow me.
*Leaves*
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
…
Hey, Kirito.
Didn’t she sound to you like she had some kind of story with this place?
Oh well, it can be my imagination…
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
Hey, are you coming or not?
*neko*
*happyRightPosition*
Why, yes! We’re right after you!
*waves energically* 
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
I am NOT talking to you, stray cat!
*normalLeftPosition*
…
…
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
…
…
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
…Huh?
Isn’t this bar we just passed very similar to the one we met earlier?
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…It’s not just similar, it’s the same.
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, did you forget something inside then?
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
W-what?! No!
I JUST GOT LOST, OK?! I SCREWED UP!
So go ahead and laugh…
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Hm? Why should I?
*happyRightPosition*
I lose my way all of the time. It’s perfectly normal, you see.
*angel*
*normalLeftPosition*
No, it’s not.
*neko*
*angryRightPosition*
Aaaah, who cares?
*normalRightPosition*
Let’s ask for directions then!
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
…Thank you.
*neko*
*happyRightPosition*
Aww, it’s ok. You’re very welcome!
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
I WASN’T TALKING TO YOU!
