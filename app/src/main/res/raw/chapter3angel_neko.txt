I followed the girls to a big avenue close to the bar we were a bit earlier.
It seemed the most promising place to look for directions since the narrow streets back there were almost empty at this time of the day, but…
This place wasn’t much different if you ask me.
There was a convenience store pretty much run down, a photo booth hidden in a fishy dead end and an old railroad in the background.
However there wasn’t any people to be found here. At all.
It actually makes sense since we are in the hottest month of summer and it’s almost noon.
I thought we would stand out like a sore thumb dressing like this, but seems like humidity and this oppressive heat was keeping people to come out from home.
And the thing is…
I didn’t know if I felt glad or upset by it.
To be honest I was secretly relieved of not having to admit to a random stranger that I was lost while looking like this.
So even if that means I’ll miss that cosplay event I still rather stay here cooking my ass under the sun than having to go through that.
Besides, I just wanted to go there -partially- because I wanted to try my luck meeting some girl, so…
I think I’m well served in that regard.

…
Kiwito?
Is there something wrong? You look like you’re thinking a lot about something.
*buttons*
Oh, I was just thinking I’m lucky to have you both with me.
Oh, it’s nothing. Sorry to have worried you.
Yeah, this is a complete disaster…
*happyLeftPosition*
Oh, that’s so sweet! It’s the same for me, y’know? I’m not that good orientating myself so I’d be in trouble without you.
*normalLeftPosition*
Are you sure? You can trust me. My lips are sealed!
*angryLeftPosition*
Well, I know that but you could be more optimistic about it, y’know?
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
Hey, can I know what the two of you are talking about?
Y’know, it’s quite rude to exclude someone of a conversation.
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Oh, it’s Kiwito. He seemed to be thinking very hard about something.
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, is that so?
*angryRightPosition*
In that case you could use the time to be a bit useful and help me looking for the place or someone that could help us getting there.
But no, you’re both here doing nothing, staring at the scenery while I do all the work. Not that I’m surprised, that is.
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Oh, I’m sorry! It’s just I thought you were slightly familiar with the place while I’m not so…
I thought of staying behind to avoid getting into trouble.
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
…Getting into trouble?
*normalRightPosition*
Ha! I was about to ask “how?” but…
It’s a quite plausible excuse, now that I think about it…
*happyRightPosition*
I mean, you’re not the brightest bulb on the box, you know what I mean?
*buttons*
Hey, there is no need to be mean.
Hey, we are all lost here, remember?
Well, you are not too bright either…
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
A-ah?! I wasn’t saying that as an insult. Well, at least completely…
*normalRightPosition*
Yeah, I know that, Kichi… Believe me, I know.
*angryRightPosition*
W-what?! Say that again, you stupid piece of-!
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Hey, now do you mention bright stuff, aren’t you looking a bit too pale?
Is that make-up or…?
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
…U-uh?
I think…
I think I’m feeling… a bit queasy.
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Oh, so that’s what you meant by that bulb thing?
*angryLeftPosition*
Kiwito! Her head is hurting, that could be the heat, right?
I-I know, I’ll go get some water, you take care of her, ok?
Wait here!!
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
W-wait, I can… take care of myself!
*buttons*
I know, but don’t push yourself too much, ok?
Sure, but sit down and rest for a bit.
*ignore her* Hey, where are you going?!
*happyRightPosition*
A-all right, I won’t… Thanks.
*normalRightPosition*
Ok, I will…
*angryRightPosition*
Ha! Isn’t there anything else you can think of other than bwebs, you perv?
*normalRightPosition*
…
*angryRightPosition*
Hey, I’m… sorry about earlier.
I know I can be hard to deal with sometimes, it’s just…
I-I can’t control it, especially when I’m nervous.
*buttons*
Does that mean you were nervous before?
It’s ok, don’t worry about that.
That sounds like a lame excuse to me.
*happyRightPosition*
W-well, I WAS going to go on a blind date with someone I met online, so…
*normalRightPosition*
No, I insist. I treated you horribly…
*angryRightPosition*
Well, I can’t blame you for hating me now…
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Guys-guys-guys, I’m back!
Here, I stole this from the convenience store. Drink it slowly!
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
Wait, you what?!
*normalRightPosition*
…Well, I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that.
*glug glug*
*glug glug*
*angryRightPosition*
…T-thank you, and-
I’m… sorry.
*neko*
*happyLeftPosition*
Hehe, she seems to be much better now. Thanks for taking care of her, Kiwito.
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
Huh? You don’t need to do that. I mean, he didn’t do anything, anything at all!
*neko*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
Is something the matter?
*neko*
*angryLeftPosition*
Hm? It’s nothing, it’s just…
*normalLeftPosition*
Guys, what day is it?
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
August 2nd, why?
*neko*
*happyLeftPosition*
Exactly, I knew it!
That damn poster was wrong, ha, ha!
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
Wait, what poster are you talking about?
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Oh, that one that is inside the convenience store. It’s supposed to be advertising the con we’re attending but-
It said the cosplay event was held the 9th this month, not the 2nd. That’s bonkers!
*angel*
*normalRightPosition*
…
*angryRightPosition*
Oh, c’mon!! You have to be kidding me!
You silly cat, that means we got the date wrong!!
*neko*
*angryLeftPosition*
W-what, really?! But that cannot be!
I remember clearly how the online site stated it was the 2nd!
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
Me too, but that would explain why we can’t find any other people in their cosplay around here, don’t you think?
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Well, I don’t know about that…
Maybe all them got lost as well!
*angel*
*happyRightPosition*
Ah, ha…
Ah, ha, ha, ha!
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
He, he, he… Did I say something funny?
Anyway, I’m glad you recovered your energy…
*happyLeftPosition*
You have a cute smile, y’know? You should do it more!
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
Hey, a-are you messing up with me? Because you’re not going to get anything from complimenting me…
*normalRightPosition*
Anyway, I suppose this means we are splitting, aren’t we?
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
I guess so, but we will meet again next week, right?
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
…Sure.
I mean, get the place right the next time, you hear me Kipi?
*neko*
*happyLeftPosition*
He, he, he… Ha, ha, ha!
*angel*
*angryRightPosition*
W-wait, what are you laughing at, kitty?!
*normalRightPosition*
Anyway, I’m leaving. Thanks a lot for everything.
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
You’re welcome! It’s been fun being around you two, he, he.
Take care!
