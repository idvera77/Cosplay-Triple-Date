…
What am I even doing here?
I can’t believe I finally came
This is stupid, I should go home and forget about it. I bet she didn’t even come
I mean, who would? Coming to a blind date to go to a random cosplay event…
My friends told me about this website where you can contact girls to invite them out
I always thought these sites were lame, but since I’m called “the eternal bachelor” they insisted me to try it out and test my luck
They even gave me some tips to flirt, written on a piece of paper
Of course I didn’t have any intention to even read the thing but…
I was nervous
And it’s true that I don’t want to drop by that event dressed like this all alone, so…
I felt that I could use anything, whatever word of advice or ruse to make me look cool and interesting –specially- now that I’m dressed like an idiot
So I eagerly reached for that piece of paper and opened it
It read: “Don’t start babbling nonsense to girls”
“Just shut your damn mouth and let them do the talking. Women love guys that pay attention and hear all their stuff without complaining”
“And since you’re not that sweet of a talker, play the misterious guy role and cover your sorry ass”
“With love, your friends”
What kind of friends do I have?!
Now, even more nervous than before, I look around the bar where I planned our meeting
It was empty except for three girls
They were scattered across the place, sitting on different tables so I asume they didn’t come together but…
…Are them all wearing cosplay?
It’s true this place is close by the place where the event is taking place but…
Okay, you’re here not to think but to flirt!
I’ll have to ask around to find out who’s the one I chatted with, I guess…
So I took a deep breath and came closer to the nearest girl
Hey, are you waiting for someone?
*neko*
*normalCenterPosition*
Why, yes! Are you “kirito_senpai_69”?
…
*happyCenterPosition*
Oh, that’s great! For a moment here I thought you wouldn’t show up
I’m so glad you came! I just moved in to study in college and none of my peers like these things so I had no one to come to the cosplay event
I found that site online looking for the schedule info but I didn’t think I could find a partner to go with!
*normalCenterPosition*
Technology is a wonderful thing, don’t you think?
Well, tell me, which character are you cosplaying?
*botones*
A drama/romantic visual novel hero
The protagonist of an adventure anime
The bringer of death and destruction
*happyCenterPosition*
Really?! You have to tell me which one it is. I absolutely love those!
*normalCenterPosition*
Oh, now that you mention it, it does seem familiar
*angryCenterPosition*
W-why would anyone cosplay that?
*normalCenterPosition*
Nevermind, I’d like to know more about you
I mean, here I am going on and on forever about me, so…
Tell me, what do you do for a living?
*botones*
I’m studying in college
I’m working part time
Ah, ha! Well, that’s funny…
*happyCenterPosition*
Oh, so you’re like me! Maybe we have crossed paths in the campus without realizing, isn’t that cool?
*normalCenterPosition*
Really? That’s nice
*angryCenterPosition*
Uh, what’s exactly funny? You don’t want to tell me, is that it?
*normalCenterPosition*
Anyway, sorry for the sudden change of topic but…
Do you know that girl seated over there? She is staring at us all the time, it’s like she knows you or something
…
You don’t?
Then why don’t you go there and invite her to come with us? She’s on her cosplay so I’m sure she’s coming to the event as well
*happyCenterPosition*
C’mon, go-go-go!
*angel*
*normalCenterPosition*

…Hi
You’re not… by any chance…?
*angryCenterPosition*
…ki..kiwi… 69?
*botones*
Yes, that’s me
I think so, but you’re saying it all wrong
No, I don’t know who’s that
*happyCenterPosition*
What a relief… I feared you’d ghosted me
*normalCenterPosition*
Oh, is that so? I’m… sorry. I’m kinda bad with japanese names
*angryCenterPosition*
Oh, really? If you don’t want to meet anymore it’s ok, you can say so…
