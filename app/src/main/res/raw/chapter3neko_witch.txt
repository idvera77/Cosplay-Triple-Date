I followed the girls to a big avenue close to the bar we were a bit earlier.
It seemed the most promising place to look for directions since the narrow streets back there were almost empty at this time of the day, but…
This place wasn’t much different if you ask me.
There was a convenience store pretty much run down, a photo booth hidden in a fishy dead end and an old railroad in the background.
However there wasn’t any people to be found here. At all.
It actually makes sense since we are in the hottest month of summer and it’s almost noon.
I thought we would stand out like a sore thumb dressing like this, but seems like humidity and this oppressive heat was keeping people to come out from home.
And the thing is…
I didn’t know if I felt glad or upset by it.
To be honest I was secretly relieved of not having to admit to a random stranger that I was lost while looking like this.
So even if that means I’ll miss that cosplay event I still rather stay here cooking my ass under the sun than having to go through that.
Besides, I just wanted to go there -partially- because I wanted to try my luck meeting some girl, so…
I think I’m well served in that regard.

Hu, hu…
What are you looking at, sweetie?
*buttons*
U-uh, I think yours… -y’know- are showing…
N-nothing! *blush*
Sorry, I was just absent-minded for a bit.
*happyLeftPosition*
Ha, ha! I knew that already, sweetheart…
*normalLeftPosition*
I wish I knew what is exactly that “nothing” that makes you blush like that.
*angryLeftPosition*
I see. You should focus in what’s in front of you instead of being somewhere else, boy.
*neko*
*happyRightPosition*
Hey, guys! I have good news!
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
Oh, really? Did you find anyone we could ask for help?
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Well, I’ve just walked in that convenience store and seemed to be empty, BUT-!
That means we have snacks, FOR FREE!
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
Ha, ha! Missy, I don’t think that’s what it means…
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Whyf not? Itf’s hisf faultb for leavfing the ztore unnatendedb *stuffs her face with cake*
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
Oh, my… I think I’m starting to understand why you have those.
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Thoseb? *noms*
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
-Those-, indeed.
Right, boy?
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Huh? Do you know what she means, Kirito?
*buttons*
No, I don’t have the slightest idea.
I think so, but I’d rather… not say.
She is referring to your tits.
*happyRightPosition*
Oh, I know! She meant my cheeks. C’mon, touch! They’re soft and peachy, he, he…
*normalRightPosition*
Aww, you’re mean! Tell me, tell me!
*angryRightPosition*
W-what?! A-are you laughing at me?
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
Forget about him and the cake for a moment, kitty.
Did you find any other remarkable thing when we splitted ways?
Something that could help us find the place of the event?
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Hm, well…
There was a poster inside the convenience store advertising the cosplay con.
*angryRightPosition*
But it was weird.
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
Weird, how?
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Well, because it said…
That the event is a week from now.
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
…
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
…
*witch*
*angryLeftPosition*
…Are you sure about that?
*neko*
*happyRightPosition*
Positive!
*normalRightPosition*
But that’s impossible, because the event is taking place today, isn’t it?
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
…Ha, ha.
Ah, ha, ha, ha!
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Uh? Wait, why is she laughing?
Kirito?
*buttons*
Because it seems like the website got the info all wrong.
I think she got a heat stroke.
She is laughing at you, silly.
*happyRightPosition*
Oh, I see! W-wait, but then…!
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, poor thing! Should I steal a bottle of water from the convenience store?
*angryRightPosition*
H-huh? Who do you think you’re calling silly… S-silly?!
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
Ha, ha, ha… ha! I can’t laugh anymore…!
*normalLeftPosition*
Well, we are not going anywhere today it seems.
*neko*
*angryRightPosition*
So was it true? The cosplay con is next week instead?
What a let down…
Maybe it’s hard to tell but I worked very hard on my costume to get it ready for today.
*witch*
*normalLeftPosition*
Well, you -can- come again next week and attend.
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
…
*happyRightPosition*
Hey, you’re right!
Thank you, lady! You’re a lifesaver.
And you too, Kirito!
I hope we see each other in the cosplay event next week.
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
Ha, ha, ha! I certainly hope so too…
*normalLeftPosition*
Should we go home, then?
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
I guess so, but…
*happyRightPosition*
It was really fun to hang out with you guys!
Let’s do this again sometime!  
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
Sure, Kitty. I’ll pat you whenever you want.
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Hm? Did you say something?
*witch*
*happyLeftPosition*
Hu, hu… I wonder.
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, it was a pleasure to meet you. Be careful on your way back, ok?
*neko*
*normalRightPosition*
Of course, be careful you too!
