…
What am I even doing here?
I can’t believe I ended up coming.
This is stupid, I should go home and forget about it. I bet she didn’t even come.
I mean, who would? Coming to a blind date to go to a random cosplay event…
My friends told me about this website where you can contact girls to invite them out.
I always thought these sites were lame, but since I’m called “the eternal bachelor” they insisted me to try it out and test my luck.
They even gave me some tips to flirt, written on a piece of paper.
Of course I didn’t have any intention to even read the thing but…
I was nervous.
And it’s true that I don’t want to drop by that event dressed like this all alone, so…
I felt that I could use anything, whatever word of advice or ruse to make me look cool and interesting -specially- now that I’m dressed like an idiot.
So I eagerly reached for that piece of paper and opened it.
It read: “Don’t start babbling nonsense to girls.”
“Just shut your damn mouth and let them do the talking. Women love guys that pay attention and hear all their stuff without complaining.”
“And since you’re not that sweet of a talker, play the mysterious guy role and cover your sorry ass.”
“With love, your friends.”
What kind of friends do I have?!
Now, even more nervous than before, I look around the bar where I planned our meeting.
It was empty except for three girls.
They were scattered across the place, sitting on different tables so I assume they didn’t come together but…
…Are them all wearing cosplay?
It’s true that this place is close by the place where the event is taking place but…
Okay, you’re here not to think but to flirt!
I’ll have to ask around to find out who’s the one I chatted with, I guess…
So I took a deep breath and came closer to the nearest girl.
Hey, are you waiting for someone?
*neko*
*normalCenterPosition*
Why, yes! Are you “kirito_senpai_69”?
…
*happyCenterPosition*
Oh, that’s great! For a moment there I thought you wouldn’t show up.
I’m so glad you came! I've just moved in to study in college and none of my peers like these things so I had no one to come to the cosplay event.
I found that site online looking for the schedule info but I didn’t think I could find a partner to go with!
*normalCenterPosition*
Technology is a wonderful thing, don’t you think?
Well, tell me, which character are you cosplaying?
*buttons*
A drama/romantic visual novel hero.
The protagonist of an adventure anime.
The bringer of death and destruction.
*happyCenterPosition*
Really?! You have to tell me which one it is. I absolutely love those!
*normalCenterPosition*
Oh, now that you mention it, it does seem familiar.
*angryCenterPosition*
W-why would anyone cosplay that?
*normalCenterPosition*
Nevermind, I’d like to know more about you.
I mean, here I am going on and on forever about me, so…
Tell me, what do you do for a living?
*buttons*
I’m studying in college.
I’m working part time.
Ah, ha! Well, that’s funny…
*happyCenterPosition*
Oh, so you’re like me! Maybe we have crossed paths in the campus without realizing, isn’t that cool?
*normalCenterPosition*
Really? That’s nice.
*angryCenterPosition*
Uh, what’s exactly funny? You don’t want to tell me, is that it?
*normalCenterPosition*
Anyway, sorry for the sudden change of topic but…
Do you know that girl seated over there? She is staring at us all the time, it’s like she knows you or something.
…
You don’t?
Then why don’t you go there and invite her to come with us? She’s on her cosplay so I’m sure she’s coming to the event as well.
*happyCenterPosition*
C’mon, go-go-go!
*angel*
*normalCenterPosition*
…
…Hi.
You’re not… by any chance…?
*angryCenterPosition*
…ki..kiwi… 69?
*buttons*
Yes, that’s me.
I think so, but you’re saying it all wrong.
No, I don’t know who’s that.
*happyCenterPosition*
What a relief… I feared you’d ghosted me.
*normalCenterPosition*
Oh, is that so? I’m… sorry. I’m kinda bad with those weeb names.
*angryCenterPosition*
Oh, really? If you don’t want to meet anymore it’s ok, you can say so…
*normalCenterPosition*
…
What?
What do you mean if I’m the girl you talked with?
Why would -I- be here of all places if not?
*angryCenterPosition*
This is not precisely my style, you see.
It’s not my intention to offend anyone, but this is dark, dusty and kinda smelly.
You know, not the kind of place a girl would want to meet in her dream date.
*buttons*
I’m sorry.
I just picked this place because it’s close by.
I think you got your hopes too high if you ask me.
*happyCenterPosition*
It’s ok, I don’t even know why I said that. Just forget about it, alright?
*normalCenterPosition*
I thought so, but even then this place is just…
*angryCenterPosition*
W-wha, w-what did you just-?!
*normalCenterPosition*
…Ahem
I truly –hate- to stop our conversation here but…
That woman in the back is staring…
*angryCenterPosition*
Well, that’s wouldn’t be the word for it. She’s GLARING our way.
*normalCenterPosition*
And I think you’re the cause.
Could you go to her table and talk to her?
*happyCenterPosition*
…Please?
*angryCenterPosition*
Oh, c’mon! Go there already. *angry push*
*mature*
*normalCenterPosition*
My, my, be careful, boy…
*happyCenterPosition*
If you trip and fall you could damage that sweet face of yours.
*normalCenterPosition*
Tell me, are you my handsome knight in shining armor?
*buttons*
(Blushing) W-w-what?!
Are you… role playing?
Are you crazy, ma’m?
*happyCenterPosition*
Ha, ha, ha! I’ll take that as a “maybe”.
*normalCenterPosition*
Of course, isn’t that what cosplay is all about?
*angryCenterPosition*
Who do you think you’re calling “ma’m”, kiddo?
*normalCenterPosition*
You’re that guy, right? The one I talked to in the cosplay forum.
I have to say I didn’t expect someone your age would pick a place like this to meet.
*happyCenterPosition*
Maybe this means we have something else in common…
…I wonder, he, he.
*normalCenterPosition*
I’m sensing good vibes coming from you, but…
Do you mind if I run a little compatibility test here?
*happyCenterPosition*
Don’t worry, it will be easy.
*normalCenterPosition*
Okay, so…
How do you like –it-?
*buttons*
Strong, rough and wild.
-It-? You mean… alcohol?
Mild and sweet.
*happyCenterPosition*
…Bullseye.
*normalCenterPosition*
What else did you think I could be referring to?
*angryCenterPosition*
…Oh, is that so?
*normalCenterPosition*
Well, that was a pretty entertaining chat but it’s getting late.
Why don’t you go outside and wait for a bit?
I’ll be there as soon as I pay the check and get my things.
*happyCenterPosition*
See you later, boy…
